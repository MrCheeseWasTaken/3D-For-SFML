# 3D-For-SFML

```Disclaimer: The current state of the project is in early stage of development and therefore I do not recommend to use in projects```

This a small 3D library I made using SFML 2.6 and Opengl
I made this library to learn about 3D and therefore there will be some bugs

The library was inspired by SFML so it uses many of bits of SFML
